# Split-Text-ChatGPT-Google
This code splits a Google Document into sections, ensuring that each section is no longer than 2048 words. It is helpful for dividing long documents into manageable segments with complete sentences.

## Disclaimer
Despite my attempts to include code that should prevent chunks from breaking off mid-sentence, it still does. I have yet to find a solution without timing out or having Google Apps give me an error. Fortunately, the code remains effective for extracting key points from a reading or transcript when needed. If you have any recommendations on how to remedy this, please don't hesitate to leave a comment.
